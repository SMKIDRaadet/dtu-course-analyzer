## Chrome extension
The following is an explanation of how the values were calculated (higher is better)
  * Average grade
  * Average grade percentile: All courses are ranked against eachother based on average grade. 
  * Percent passed: The ratio of people who **attended** the exam that passed.
  * Course rating percentile: All course are ranked based on the question "Overall I think the course is good" from course reviews. 
  * Workscore percentile: Ranked based on the question "5 points are allocated to 9h./week (45 h./week in the 3-week period). I think my workload in the course is [Much less..Much more]"
  * Lazyscore: The average percentile between percent passed and workload. This is a metric for how much beer one can drink during a semester and still get decent grades. üç∫üç∫üç∫

## Data gathering and analysis
Data was gathered using a Python script that scraped DTU's coursebase and formatted it so that the extension can use it.

# Development
## Setup
 1. Install python dependencies `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Gather data
 1. Create a file called `secret.txt` containing the `ASP.NET_SessionId` cookie set when you are logged into https://kurser.dtu.dk with a DTU account. Make sure there is no leading or trailing whitespace and newlines.
If you are using Firefox, you can get the cookie by pressing F12, going to the storage tab, and copying the value of the `ASP.NET_SessionId` cookie.
 2. Update the list of courses using `python3 getCourseNumbers.py`
 3. Run the scraper `python3 scraper.py`
 4. Analyze the data using `python3 analyzer.py extension`
 
## Debugging
### Chrome
 1. Open the extensions page
 2. Enable developer mode (Upper right corner)
 3. Click on "Load unpacked"

 0. Install `web-ext`
     - Run `npm install --global web-ext`
